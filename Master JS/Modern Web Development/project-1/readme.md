## 🧠 How It Works

- The `#main` container is used as the `data-scroll-container` for Locomotive Scroll.
- Each section uses `data-scroll-section` for proper tracking.
- GSAP’s `ScrollTrigger` is used to hook into the scroll and trigger animations.
- The `locoscroll.js` file initializes and syncs everything.
